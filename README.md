# Shiny_app
First approach at a shiny app, combining it with web scraping.  The website the information is coming from (https://covidtracking.com/data) does have API to be able to access the data, but I wanted to work data scraping on this project.

- R version 4.0.2 is required.
- Note the plot is interactive.
